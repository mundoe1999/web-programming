    It is rather fascinating to talk about the infrastructure of our current data centers, and the forms that they can take place. In,
    It Was Raining in the Data Center, it focuses much more in Facebook's data center in Prineville. I never really understood why these
    data centers were always in the middle of nowhere Idaho (I always assumed because it was much harder to target from foreign invaders),
    but upon closer reading, it wasn't just that. The cheaper costs, low moisture, weather stability, and low amounts of human traffic,
    makes it all the perfect. However, that leaves me to wonder what is to happen on the people living in these regions? The reading mentions 
    how the place was filled with once blue collar jobs, but that has quickly died down. It seems that they also do not work in these data centers, 
    because they aren't taught nor specialized in this particular field, which leads to them not being hired. Furthermore, the reading mentions that 
    the amount of electricity that is being expended by these mega structures makes it hard to increase the electrical routings of the city and makes 
    the grid be at capacity. In my opinion, it feels <strong>exploitative.</strong> Because it is. These mega companies are taking advantage of the 
    collapsing infrastructure and stagnant economy in these empty cities, and using it to their advantage to power up their web / company. Although, 
    the reading did mention that they do follow the railroads in the U.S. to base their cities on. Maybe in the future we can take advantage of these tech 
    companies, such that we can use their locations as an incentive to revitalize our decaying infrastructure. But that's something that would 
    require a massive movement of improvement for the future.
