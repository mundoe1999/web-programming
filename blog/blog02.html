    For this week, the readings took a stronger focus on using characters (the individual letters you are seeing 
    at this very moment) as a form of conduit to producing art. Jodi's Infrastructure focuses on directly that, by
    grabbing special characters (that are done in <b>unicode</b>) and does art by playing around with 
    the web links and unicode. Originally, unicodes weren't used because the web was more of western-centric 
    conglamorate of computers, but that rapidly changed as more and more users around the world began using it. 
    Specifically, more users that do not use the latin alphabet, which means that they had a harder way of expressing 
    their thought as their writing was not compatible with the web. This, however, changed rather recently, which created 
    an explosion of language on the web that made it more worldwide. Not only that, but it also bridged the connection with art.

    In Jodi's Infrastructure, unicode is a vessel of art, rather than a veseel of communication and language. It creates a 
    new form of media that encapsulates the new age of the web by playing around with unicode. Not only that, but by doing so,
    opens up a new field of communicative art that hasn't really been seen or interpreted outside of this medium. This is why 
    it makes unicode art so immensely unique, as it is tied with the technology and it is limited by the technology itself. If 
    expressed outside of it's medium, it loses meaning and significance, which makes you appreciate this art form a lot more 
    than initially expected.
