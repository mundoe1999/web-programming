    Interconnectedness on the internet is a massive deal. It creates a beautiful social link between two people that 
    raise awareness, meaningfulness, and insightfulness of the people around them.  However, governments want to keep 
    these people segregated so that it becomes easier to control the population. This is somewhat the readings focus on, 
    in ways how people are able to connect with each other. The cute cat theory reading discusses how for very arbitrary reasons, 
    people are connected together. The "cute cat" theory is that if a website is used by a large majority of people, a government 
    cannont block the entire website for having some content that does not showcase the government in a good light. That's how 
    activists are able to get away with posting their content where dissent is suppressed, as they are able to post their activism 
    in popular sites that if taken down, the large majority of people will be in a uproar, and increase awareness of the issues 
    that activists wanted to point out. Everyone is connected to the website, and collectively they will fight back if they lose 
    access to it.

    The second reading, more lightheartedly, focuses on the creation of these connections between users. It is a very simple UNIX machine 
    where everyone is allowed to do whaterver they want. However, what I find amusing is how these people just naturally clumped up together 
    and started working in creating "infrastructure" and collaborating with each other. I say "infrastructure" as in, they were building links 
    to each other, seeing the most recently updated personal site, and whatnot. Everyone was working to make this personal space their own and leaving 
    their own footprint for the website. This reminds me of the days that I used to play in a political minecraft server called Civcraft. It was essentially
    an anarchy server (meaning that there were no rules with the exception of using game exploits or hacking and doxxing). Nobody had the obligation 
    to help each other and work collaboratively, but they did. People built these massive nations, created large tunnels and rail systems connecting each major hub,
    and each civilization had their own culture and eccentiricities that made it unique. This reading felt very much like that, and I felt nostalgic over that entire 
    wonder.
