  <h1>Re-imagining Twitter</h1>
  <p>
    For this assignment, I have decided to create different layouts for the hellish website
    <a href="https://twitter.com/home">twitter (dot) com</a>. Currently, I have created 
    some designs for this site. One of the things that I have realized while trying to modify
    the DOM is the sheer amount of divs that encapsulates most of the HTML. This makes it 
    significantly harder to modify individual elements as it either doesn't do anything or it 
    breaks everything.
  </p>
  <div class="design-card">
    <img src="./img/design-01.png" width="400px" height="300px"/>
    <p>
      This is a very basic change, I have reduced the whitespace of the navebar on the right 
      and on the left to maximize the view of the content. This way, the content is more in the forefront 
      and could be easier to see when on larger displays.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="design-card">
    <img src="./img/design-02.png" width="400px" height="300px"/>
    <p>
      This wasn't the intended result, but it got to a similar goal that I wanted. I removed 
      the trends for you section because I absolutely despise looking
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="design-card">
    <img src="./img/design-03.png" width="400px" height="300px"/>
    <p>
      I like the colors, so I chose this design. There should be more liberty to change how your 
      twitter is displayed, similar to Tumblr. I also removed the trendings because I hate it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="design-card">
    <img src="./img/design-04.png" width="400px" height="300px"/>
    <p>
      This is more of an interactive experience, but what I switched the flow direction so that it was reversed. 
      What this resulted was the oldest contest constantly appearing, until it froze and broke. I like it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="design-card">
    <img src="./img/design-05.png" width="400px" height="300px"/>
    <p>
      Content but instead of everyone seeing each others content, you simply scream into the aether. Maybe
      someone will read what you wrote when they access the database, but otherwise, they won't.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="design-card">
    <img src="./img/design-06.png" width="400px" height="300px"/>
    <p>
      Twitter is gone. Now everyone is free and can feel liberated.
