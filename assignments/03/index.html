  <h1>How Far Away From Hunter?</h1>
  <p>
    For this assignment, we needed to do an API call but give it a unique twist. I decided to take inspiration from <a href="http://istheapplebeesondelcoparkdrinthesuburbsofdaytonopenrightnow.com/">http://istheapplebeesondelcoparkdrinthesuburbsofdaytonopenrightnow.com/</a>
    however I decided to give a twist. I wanted to experiment a little bit using the canvas API, in which I used in the past to create interactive games and projects. I used the Open Cage 
    API to give me the latitude and longitude of Hunter College and the inputted address. With that, I calculated the distance between those two addresses, and rendered a square based on that. 
    The smaller the square, the further away you are from it. The sqaure becomes bigger / smaller as you move the arrow keys, to make it look like you are travelling back and forth.
