  <h1>How Far Away From Hunter?</h1>
  <div style="float: left;">
    <p class="block-l">
      For this assignment, we needed to do an API call but give it a unique twist. I decided to take inspiration from <a href="http://istheapplebeesondelcoparkdrinthesuburbsofdaytonopenrightnow.com/">http://istheapplebeesondelcoparkdrinthesuburbsofdaytonopenrightnow.com/</a>
      however I decided to give a twist. I wanted to experiment a little bit using the canvas API, in which I used in the past to create interactive games and projects. I used the Open Cage 
      API to give me the latitude and longitude of Hunter College and the inputted address. With that, I calculated the distance between those two addresses, and rendered a square based on that. 
      The smaller the square, the further away you are from it. The sqaure becomes bigger / smaller as you move the arrow keys, to make it look like you are travelling back and forth.
    </p>
  
    <p class="block-l">
      I'm a bit unsatisfied with how the square is being rendered, I wanted it to be a bit more dynamic in it's shape
      (as in, as you move from center to left, it gets thinner until you move it back to the center). However, that turned out 
      a lot harder than I have initially anticipated (tried to set up an algorithm that would do the panning, but it backfired considerably). I have, though,
      made it functional enough that when you type an address, the square changes somewhat in a relative position on how far away 
      you are form that destination, which was my desired goal, albeit somewhat incomplete.
    </p>
