  <h1>Shuffling Done Weird</h1>
  <p>
    This assignment focuses on providing alternative methods to shuffling a basic deck.
    The first method was done similar to how I handled tournament seeding for an internship, whereas the 
    second one goes for a more random (and a bit naive) way of shuffling a card. Both of these 
    methods do shuffle the deck, so I am perfectly fine with the results. Both of these methods start by
    generating a sorted deck of cards.
  </p>
  <h2>Method 1: Pushing into an array</h2>
  <p>
    For this method, I have decided to randomly grab a card from the sorted deck and insert it 
    to the new deck. I used the splice method to remove an element from the original deck, and then 
    inserted into the new deck until the original deck is empty.
  </p>
  <button id="genButt" onclick="ShuffleOne(generateDeck())">Method One</button>
  <h2>Method 2: Randomly Swapping positions</h2>
  <p>
    Using one deck, I would go through each card and swap that card with a random card that isn't the 
    card we intend to swap it with. I personally like this method more, as I am not using the splice method, 
    and there's more flexibility to make expand the way this can be shuffled more efficiently (does not swap 
    with positions it already has swapped with || can swap with itself || merge sort but make instead of sorting 
    randomize each value).
  </p>
