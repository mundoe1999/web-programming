    <p>
      This project is very different to any of the current projects shown to date. This is because this is not meant for this class. However, since the
      requirements of the project I needed to produce overlapped with another project I was assigned the same day (for a Spotify Fellowship Program), I will
      be showcasing that for this week. This web application is supposed to be a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project in which users have a stock
      porfolio, and they are able to create an account and buy stocks. The current prices of the stocks need to be shown and should be able to buy about 5000$
      worth of stocks. My project incorporates all of that. It feels pretty self explanatory (I really hated working with auth), so it's just fun to play around
      with. Below are the links for the project.
